Ensure that the ERC20 token contract address is provided as a constructor parameter when deploying this contract.
This is a simplified version of a DeFi protocol and does not include advanced features like interest rates, collateral management, or liquidation mechanisms.
Users should approve the contract to transfer tokens on their behalf before interacting with the protocol.
Carefully review the code and ensure it meets your project's requirements before deployment.
